  - You again?
  - Surprised?
  - Don't get your nickers in a twist! What'll it be then?
  - Yes, of course!
  - Ready to enter?
  - Yes, let me pass.
  - No, not yet.
  - You should use the anvil behind you to upgrade your sword. It'll give you the
    edge you sorely need against the dragon
  - You seem to be well-equipped for dragon slaying! Are you ready to take on the
    beast?
  - Yes, let me pass.
  - No, not yet.
  - Hold! Beyond this portal lies a defenceless village beset by a fearsome dragon.
    Go gird yourself with yonder mighty sword and return.
  - Why don't you use the anvil behind you to empower your blade for next time?
  - You have been recalled back in time. The dragon is poised yet again to lay waste
    to the village. Are you ready for another attempt?
  - Is there nothing here that could give me an edge against the monster?
  - Ready for another attempt?
  - Once more into the breach?
  - Why are there so many useless tools strewn about? I will need more than pitchforks
    to save this village.
  - You're awfully sure of your methods, aren't you hero?
  - I must fell the dragon more quickly. The village will only be spared if my sword
    becomes powerful enough to fell it in a single strike.
  - Each time I slay this dragon, the villagers' lives are upended. I must do better
    to ensure they can avoid this fate.
  - Such a noble aim. Then surely your sword and your dedication are sufficient.
    No need to burden your bags with these pointless implements.
